Welcome to the SmittE YouTube Channel website! I just have a bunch of random crap here... Mostly Batch files and stuff I thought was cool.
This website is mostly a project for the school club I'm in called TSA (Technology Student Assosiation). My team will
also be making a game that will be uploaded here soon. ^-^</font>
